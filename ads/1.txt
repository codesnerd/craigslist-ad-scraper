Charles Wysocki - Christmas Lithograph - Jingle Bell Teddy and Friends -- 
Autographed w/ Personal Remark 
The Greenwich Workshop 1990 Christmas Print
My husband bought this lithograph at a reception for Charles Wysocki. He was introduced to Mr. Wysocki (Chuck). They spoke all night and at the end of the night, Chuck took the print and added the personal remarks with autograph. This makes it a one of a kind.
"For this year's special Christmas print, I harkened back to my youth and looked at Christmas through eyes of a child. I remember, as a boy, dreaming of building an anormous teddy bear in the snow, and here, finally, I've done just that.
The antique Christmas ornaments and Santas perched in and around the tree have a personal significance to me. My wife and I have collected them over the year, and every Christmas they adorn our home." Charles Wysocki
