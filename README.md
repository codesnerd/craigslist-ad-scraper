# Craigslist Ad Scraper

## 🧾 About the Project
A Craigslist ad scraper that scrapes ads from Craigslist, stores each ad in a separate file, and lets the user search from those files.

### Built With

This ad scraper is built in [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/) using:
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

### Prerequisites
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) should be installed and properly configured on your system.
* Both `.py` and `.ipynb` files contain the same source code.
